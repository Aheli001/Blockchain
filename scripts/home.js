<h1 class="heading">What is Blockchain?</h1>
<p class="contentText">Blockchain is a <strong>distributed ledger technology (DLT)</strong> that allows data to be stored across a network of computers in a decentralized, immutable, and transparent manner. It is the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and has expanded to support smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and supply chain systems, among other use cases.</p>

            Conceptual Foundation:
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>The idea of a decentralized ledger was introduced in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.</li>
            <li>They proposed a cryptographically secured chain of blocks to timestamp digital documents and prevent tampering.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bitcoin Era (2008):
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Blockchain was first implemented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto in the whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."</li>
            <li>Blockchain served as the underlying technology for Bitcoin, ensuring decentralized and tamper-proof transactions.</li>

            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Primary use case: Digital currencies.</li>
            <li>Example: Bitcoin (BTC).</li>
            <li>Focus: Secure and decentralized transfer of digital assets.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Blockchain 2.0 (Smart Contracts):
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Introduced programmable logic with Ethereum in 2015.</li>
            <li>Smart contracts enabled automation of agreements without intermediaries.</li>
            <li>Expanded use cases: Finance (DeFi), token creation (ERC-20), and more.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Blockchain 3.0 (Decentralized Applications):
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Focused on scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency.</li>
            <li>Example: Solana, Polkadot, Cardano.</li>
            <li>Applications in industries beyond finance: Healthcare, supply chain, gaming.</li>
